* XML library:
  The current solution for parsing and writing XML is to use Xerces. I am unsure
  whether or not this is a good solution. On one hand it gives us a powerful
  library for XML management, but on the other hand it might be a bit too much.

* XML in memory:
  XML data is currently loaded in memory during execution. This is wasteful.
